This was a little side project that transformed a few times through it's life.  It started as a design for a comic story I was helping to create, was re-designed as it was looking a bit derivative, to finally becoming an image piece.  It was quite fun to create and I hope enjoyable to look at.  Credit goes to [Vitaly Bulgarov][0] for a few of the kit bash pieces used and Sean Amlaner for the comp.
